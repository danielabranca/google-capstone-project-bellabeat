# google-capstone-project-bellabeat
This project is part of Google's/Coursera Data Analytics course completion and it was my first DA project ever. 

It regards a real fitness tech company that gave free access to some of its data of 2016 and aimed to study the trends of its users and of the back then market with the purpose of developing marketing strategies to better commercialize its products. 

Other than the course content, my main guiding references were the works by other members of GitHub community (mainly sbnkn and Roc-Data-Analyst). Due to them I learnt a lot! 
Thank you!
